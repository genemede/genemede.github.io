Using a common ontology for data will allow communities to easily search and share information. It is comprised of the following components: The GAT The GAT - Genemede Api and Tools - is a python project meant to be run locally. It will store data and allow for several operations, including search and export. https://github.com/genemede/gnmd-gat The GUI The GUI is a Web Application used to interact with the GAT APIs. Repository at github The HUB (in development) The HUB is an online platform meant to facilitate the exchange of information such as ontologies. Repository at github The Genemede Metatypes (in development) This is a collection of officially curated metatypes by the Genemede project. Repository at github What can Genemede do Create researchers, subjects, projects and labs; Edit relationships between created objects; Search data and view relationships; Export all data as a Genemede json file. How to install Genemede Installing the GAT Download the repository via github git clone https://github.com/genemede/gnmd-gat and follow the instructions on the README file. Installing and building the GUI Download the repository via github git clone https://github.com/genemede/gnmd-gui and follow the instructions on the README file.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#genemede","text":"","title":"Genemede"},{"location":"about/#what-is-genemede","text":"Genemede aims to provide the means to build ontologies for general purpose data, in turn allowing the creation of a comprehensive ontology for describing neuroscience research projects, along with a set of tools to record, search and interact with data using standardized rules.
